Promise.any() Method
1) The Promise.any() takes an iterable Object, such as an Array of promises as an input. Once a promise is fulfilled, a single promise is returned and the promise is resolved using the value of the promise.
2) If no promises in the iterable fulfill (if all of the given promises are rejected), then the returned promise is rejected with an AggregateError (that groups together individual errors).

Fulfillment of Promise.any()
1) Unlike Promise.all(), this method is used to return the first promise that fulfills.
2) It is short-circuited right after a promise is completed, so as soon as a promise is fulfilled, it will not wait for other promises to complete.
3) When a non-empty iterable is passed, and any of the promises fulfill, or are non-promises, then the promise returned by this method is fulfilled asynchronously.

Rejection of Promise.any()
1) Promise.any() rejects with an AggregateError if no promise fulfils.
2) The AggregateError object represents an error when several errors need to be wrapped in a single error. It is thrown when multiple errors need to be reported by an operation.
