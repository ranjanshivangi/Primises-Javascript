Promise.prototype.finally()
1) The finally() method returns a Promise.
2) When a Promise is completed, either resolved or rejected,this specified callback function is executed.
3) This helps to avoid duplicating code in both the promise's then() and catch() handlers.
4) The finally() method will help if you're going to do any processing or cleanup work once a promise is made, regardless of the outcome.
